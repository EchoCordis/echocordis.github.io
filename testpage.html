		<h1>TEST</h1>
			<p>
				My preferred future career would be a career as a <span class="highlight">game developer</span>. It wouldn't matter if I worked for a major gaming company or as an independent game developer. However, I wouldn't mind 
				working for a company like <span class="highlight">Valve or Nintendo</span>, as they have made some of my favourite games. Personally, I want to develop a game inspired by Kingdom Hearts and the game should have a fast-paced combat system.
				It would be pretty difficult for me to make design and develop a game all by myself, as I'm not a good artist or a musician because art and music are extremely important for a good game. I could always just make
				a text-based adventure game, but that would be pretty boring.
			</p>
			<p>
				A secondary choice of career for me would probably be a mobile app developer. Mobile apps are more popular than ever with almost everyone owning their own phone. It would be interesting to try and develop and app
				that is useful and can run on both Apple and Android. Mobile technology is also rapidly advancing with phones like the Samsung Galaxy Fold being released. It would be pretty unique to be one of the first people to develop
				an app for the newest phone technology on the market.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another thing I want to do is to travel to other parts of the globe. Iceland and Greenland are two countries that I want to visit in the near future as they both
				really nice sights. If I ever have any computing opportunities overseas then I would use them to travel the world and see more sights.
