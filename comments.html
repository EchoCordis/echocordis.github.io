		<h3>Technical Considerations</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="images/structure.jpg" target="new"><img src="images/structure.jpg" alt="Website Structure" class="structure"></a> <!--Self-created diagram -->
				The website's structure consists of four key sections: the header, the footer, the navigation menu and the middle text column.<br>
				The <strong>header</strong> is located at the top of the page and features a coloured background and the name of the page.
				The <strong>footer</strong> is located at the bottom of the page and contains a link to the top of the page.
				The <strong>navigation menu</strong> is located beneath the header. It contains links to the other pages on the website.
				The <strong>middle text column</strong> is the central area of each page. It has a white background and most of each page's content is located
				within that area.
			</p>

					<td>Refers to the bottom of the webpage, which contains a link to the top of the page, as well as my name. Declared as an id as there is only one header on each page.</td>
				</tr>

					<td>The center column of the website which contains the main text and images of each page. </td>
				</tr>				
				<tr>

		<h3>Aesthetic Considerations</h3>		
			<p>
				<a href="images/colour-palette.jpg" target="new"><img src="images/colour-palette.jpg" alt="Colour Palette" class="palette"></a> <!--Self-created diagram -->
				The website features a green palette, chosen because green is my favourite colour. The shades of green used are <span id="headergreen">#48af48</span> and <span class="footergreen">#00a555.</span>
				Multiple shades of green are used so that the theme of the website remains consistent. As for the background of the website the colour #e2e2e2 is used, and the middle column of the 
				website uses the colour white. The colour of the middle column was chosen to contrast with the background so that viewers can distinguish the text area from the background.
				In each table, the colour of the header row has also been customised with a background image, but also uses the colour <span class="footergreen">#00a555.</span> as a background colour to retain a consistent colour scheme across the website.
				<span class="highlight">The full colour palette of the website is shown on the right.</span> Click it to open the image at full size in a new tab.
			</p>
			<p>
				This website was designed to be simplistic and have all of the website's content located within the centre of the website. This allows for website users to be able to concentrate solely on
				the centre of the website, without having to strain their eyes moving from the far left of the screen to the far right. This is especially helpful for users with higher resolutions and larger screens.
				The contrasting colours also serve as dividers between each element of the page, which helps users to identify the purpose of each element easily.
			</p>
			<p>
				1.6 line spacing has been used in the web page so that lines are not pressed together so there is less clutter on each page. Sans-serif font has been used for the body of the page so that
				each word can be easily read. The prioritised font is <span class="highlight">Helvetica</span>, then Arial and the any font within the sans-serif font family.
			</p>
		<h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>
			<p>
				Different elements have been added to the website to provide users with ease of accessibility. This website has been tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge, in addition to the Android versions
				of Chrome and Firefox.
			</p>
			<table>		
				<tr>
					<th class="csselement">HTML/CSS element</th>
					<th class="purpose">Purpose</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Viewport meta element</td>
					<td>
						A viewport meta element has been added to the head section of the HTML page. 
						This allows for the website to automatically adjust its width depending on the size of the user's screen size. This allows for users with smaller screen resolutions, e.g. 800x600 or mobile, to be able
						to view the website without the structure of the page being disrupted.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Different coloured text</td>
					<td>
						Text in the header, navigation menu and footer have been coloured in white. This allows for the text to stand out against the green background. The current page
						selected in the navigation menu is coloured in #ffd728 to notify the user what page they're currently on.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Menu item hover</td>
					<td>
						When the cursor hovers over the menu item, the item's background colour changes from <span class="footergreen">#00a555</span> to <span id="hovergreen">#00b55d</span>.
						This helps users identify which page they are currently hovering on.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Sticky navigation menu</td>
					<td>
						The code, <span class="quote">position: sticky;</span>, was added to the website's stylesheet. This allows for the menu to remain at the top of the screen no matter how far down they scroll.
						Users can then access other pages without having to scroll to the top everytime.
