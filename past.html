		<h2>My Past</h2>
			<p>
				I graduated high school in 2018 after completing the HSC. The HSC was a difficult time for me as well as my friends as there was a huge amount of stress surrounding the exams.
				Many people in my year group believed that failing the HSC would mean that they would "screw up" their future path and prevent them from achieving their goals.
				Lots of time was spent attempting to memorise what seemed like a thousand quotes for my Advanced English essays and it was extremely frustrating to remember them during the exam.
				Sometimes during the exam, a random song would start playing in my head and would distract me from completing my essays. After the HSC exams were over, many of my friends were 
				spending their times worrying about their ATAR and whether or not they could get into their preferred courses at their preferred university. As for me, I spent my time playing
				Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to keep my mind off my ATAR. Luckily, my ATAR was high enough to get me into my preferred course :^).

				In high school I took the subject of Software Design and Development which had many coding activities. One language I learnt during that time was C#
				which I used to develop my own game in Unity 3D. The game I made was a simpler platformer which the player had to pass through an obstacle course,
				collecting coins along the way. Developing the game was a difficult and frustating task as some of my code just didn't work and some sections had
				to be completely rewritten. However, I was really proud of the end result and got 17/20 for the game. I also have previous experience in HTML and 
				CSS from high school in Information Processes and Technology, which I used to make my own website.

				I've also travelled to a few places in the world such as <span class="highlight">China, Japan, Thailand and the United States.</span> I really enjoy travelling as it lets me escape the daily routine
				I usually have at home. It also allows me to see the difference in culture between these countries and Australia. Personally, my favourite place that I have visited is
				Japan. The culture is really different compared to Australian culture, as the Japanese have a bigger emphasis on tidiness and being on time. The local trains and buses in Tokyo always arrived
				on time! Very different to the transport system in Australia. The photo on the left is a photo of the beautiful Arashiyama Bamboo forest in Kyoto, Japan that I took when I
				visited in 2019.

				Gaming is my favourite hobby and has directly influenced my choice of degree. I find playing video games to be extremely enjoyable as 
				different games in different genres can tell its own story in a very unique way. Gaming also allows me to relax after a long day and
				escape from reality. This made me very interested in creating my own games and sharing my own stories. 
				My personal favourite games of all time are Bloodborne, Terraria and Kingdom Hearts 2. Bloodborne is my favourite game due to its fantastic
				world-building through the descriptions of different items instead of through traditional cutscenes. The Lovecraftian aspect of the story was also
				really interesting as well.
